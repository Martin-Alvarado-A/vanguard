## Vanguard Color Theme for VS Code
This is a work in progress of a colorscheme I like using, its based on the color scheme for Destiny 2's Vanguard.

I was looking for a change of colors on my IDE (Sublime Text 3) and found that the vanguard colors where a nice fit on a black background, anyways this is my first (unpublished) extension so I will be working on it as i touch different languages.


### Supported languages
* Javascript
* Typescript

### Next on the table
* CSS
* HTML
* JSX
* Whatever Vue uses.

**Enjoy!**
