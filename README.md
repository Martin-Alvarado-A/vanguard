## Vanguard Color Theme for VS Code
This is a very unsaturated (mostly) color scheme, its based on the color scheme for Destiny 2's Vanguard.

I was looking for a change of colors on my IDE and found that the vanguard colors where a nice fit on a black background. As I will be working on it further and could use your help if you enjoy this.
